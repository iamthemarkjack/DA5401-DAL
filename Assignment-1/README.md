# Visualization: Uncovering the Story Behind Movie Success
## Assignment - 1 | Rohith R - EP21B030

### Hypothesis

Movies belonging to multiple genres (cross-genre movies) tend to
generate higher revenues, but do not necessarily receive higher audience
ratings.

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between the number of genres
a movie belongs to and its success, measured in terms of both revenue
and audience ratings. Using data analysis and visualization, we test
whether cross-genre movies achieve higher commercial success while not
necessarily being rated higher by viewers.

## Key Findings

-   Cross-genre movies **tend to generate higher revenues** compared to
    single-genre movies.
-   However, cross-genre movies **do not necessarily receive higher
    audience ratings**.
-   This suggests that while mixing genres may increase commercial
    appeal, it does not guarantee better critical reception.
    
## Conclusion

The hypothesis is supported: movies spanning multiple genres generally
achieve higher revenues but are not consistently rated higher by
audiences.
